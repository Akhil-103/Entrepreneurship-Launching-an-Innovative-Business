Initial Business Model Canvas
1)
Value proposition describes the bundle of products or services that create value for a specific customer segment. Examples are such as what value do we deliver to the customer? Which customer needs are we satisfying? And, what are we offering to each customer segment? Value propositions exist in quantitative and qualitative areas. Quantitative areas include price, cost reduction, risk reduction, convenience and usability. Qualitative areas include newness, performance, design, brand, and customization
2)
Customer segments define the different groups of people or organizations to serve. They have separate segments if customer needs require and justify distinct offer, of if customer reached through different channels, requires different types of relationships, are willing to pay for different aspects, and have different profitabilities. Customer segments may exist in different types. Mass market is one large group comprising only one segment, niche market is specific, specialized customer group, segmented is a slightly different customer groups, diversified is having multiple unrelated customer segments and multi-sided markets.
3)
Channels describe how a company communicates with and reaches its customer segments to deliver a value proposition. Channels helps in raising awareness of the products and services, helping customers evaluate the value proposition, allowing customers to purchase, delivering a value proposition, and providing post-purchase customer support. Channels demand consideration of key questions. For example, through which channels do our customer segments want to be reached? How can we integrate our channels? And, what measures define which channels work best?
4)
A customer relationship describes the types of relationships a company establishes with specific customer segments. It is driven by motivations to include customer acquisition, customer retention and upselling.
5)
A revenue stream represents the cash a company generates from each Customer Segment. Revenues minus costs equals to profits. There are different types of revenue streams. The first is transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments. Another type is a recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either deliver a value proposition to customers and/or provide post-purchase customer support. Revenue stream opportunities require you to ask several core questions. For what value are customers really willing to pay? For what do they currently pay (competitors)? And, how will this change in the future? Ways to generate revenue streams includes buying (asset sale), renting, subscription, licensing and advertising.
6)
Key partnership describes the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work. There are different types of partnerships which includes strategic alliances between non-competitors, joint ventures to develop new businesses, buyer-supplier relationships, and co-opetition which is a strategic partnership between competitors. Several motivations to create partnerships includes optimization and economy of scale, which is the most basic form of partnership or buyer-supplier relationship designed to optimize resources and activities (i.e. reduce cost). Another is an acquisition of particular resources and activities, to extend capabilities by relying on other firms to furnish particular resources or perform certain activities, and motivated by needs to acquire knowledge, licenses, or access to customers. Lastly is to reduce risk and uncertainty.
7)
Key resources describe the most important assets required to make a business model work. It can be physical, financial, intellectual, or human. Key resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired from key partners.
8
Key activities are the most important things a company must do to make its business model work. For example, for PC manufacturer Dell, key activities include supply chain management. And for consultancy McKinsey, key activities include problem solving.
9
A cost structure is all costs incurred to operate a business model. By creating and delivering value, maintaining customer relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs. Costs can be calculated relatively easily after defining key resources, key activities, and key partnerships Cost-driven business models focus on minimizing costs wherever possible. They aim at creating and maintaining the leanest possible cost structure, using low price value propositions, maximum automation, and extensive outsourcing. Value-driven companies are less concerned with the cost implications, and instead focus on value creation. They offer premium value propositions and a high degree of personalized service usually characterize value-driven business models.

Name: Jane Doe
Email: janedoe@email.com
Relevance: Parent of child with asthma (if your idea is a solution is a treatment for childhood asthma)
Contact Source: Jane is my neighbor.
Key Discoveries: (For the Value Propositions listed in your business model canvas, what did you learn from Jane that supports and/or contradicts your Value Propositions? Your task is not to prove that you were right in your initial thoughts - as this is rarely the case for entrepreneurs and companies. Instead, focus on trying to arrive at the best value proposition and best business model canvas by the end of our course. The interviews are a key step to making that happen).

What’s even more powerful about it is that aside from using it for marketing and communications, it can also serve as your business’ compass—it can help you and your team stay focused on what you should be doing and steer clear of what doesn’t serve your business purpose.

They are trying to determine if you would fit in at the company and if you would add value to their existing team.
An engaged employee that is aligned with the company's mission and values will be more productive and stay at the company longer. The hiring manager is trying to find out if that person is you.
You might be panicking, wondering how to answer, “Why do you want to work here?” You never want to answer this question with a blunt and thoughtless response like, “Well, the pay is good, and I need a job.”
While this may be true, you aren’t giving yourself much of a chance.
You need to prove that you’ve done the research on the company, that your core values match the objectives of the company, and that you will enjoy working there.

any executive will tell you that understanding how competitors will respond to your actions should be a critical component of strategic decision making. But ask that same person how seriously her company actually assesses competitor reaction, and she will probably roll her eyes. In a recent survey conducted by McKinsey & Company, two-thirds of strategic planners expressed a strong belief that companies should incorporate expected competitor reactions into strategic decisions. Yet in a survey conducted by David B. Montgomery, Marian Chapman Moore, and Joel E. Urbany (published in 2005 in Marketing Science), fewer than one in 10 managers recalled having done so, and fewer than one in five expected to in the future.

It’s important to understand that your products and services have a target audience that can be defined. As a marketer, your primary goal is to find ways to identify who these people are so that you can create marketing campaigns that speak to them directly.
This might sound pretty obvious, but too often marketers assume that what they offer the world has universal appeal and that their target audience is “everybody”! As much as we would all like to believe that, it’s never true and can get in the way of creating effective marketing campaigns that do talk to the right people.

One of the most famous lines from Citizen Kane is, “It's no trick to make an awful lot of money, if that's all you want is to do is make a lot of money.” If only that statement were as true as it seemed. It might be more accurate to say, “There are a lot of ways to make a lot of money .”

That’s never been truer for software businesses in particular than in the past 10-15 years, with the internet stimulating an explosion in the number of viable revenue models. Choosing which revenue model works best for your SaaS business, though, is not easy (even if that's all you want to do is choose a revenue model for your SaaS business).
6
Even when you’re a highly skilled customer support professional who’s capable of holding friendly, nuanced, and helpful conversations with your customers, some conversations can get pretty tricky. What’s the best way to tell someone they can’t have a refund or that you can’t let them log in to an account they claim to own?
To make those difficult conversations easier, we’ve put together these templates that you can use for inspiration to craft the perfect responses. Use these 10 customer service response templates and examples to craft your own replies to these tricky support requests:

Customers comprise the heart of your business model. Without (profitable) customers, your company can not survive for long. In order to better satisfy your customers, you may group them into distinct segments with common needs, jobs-to-get-done, common behaviours, or other attributes. Your business model may have one or several large or small Customer Segments. You must make a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, your business model can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of specific customer needs and jobs-to-be-done. Customer groups represent separate segments if: - Their needs require and justify a distinct Value Proposition - They are reached through different Distribution Channels - They require different types of relationships - They have a substantially different profitability - They are willing to pay for different aspects of the Value Proposition
